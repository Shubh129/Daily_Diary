CSS Box Model:
In web development, every HTML element on a webpage is considered as a rectangular box using the CSS Box Model. This model describes how the size of elements is calculated and how different layers—such as content, padding, border, and margin—interact with one another. At the core of this model is the content, which is the actual data such as text, image, or input field. Around this content, several optional layers can be applied to control spacing and layout behavior.

1. Content
The content is the area where the text, images, or other elements are displayed. This is the most fundamental part of the box model. The size of the content can be modified using CSS properties like width and height. If the content overflows its box, it can be controlled using overflow: hidden; or overflow: scroll;.

2. Padding
Padding is the space between the content and the border. It creates internal spacing inside the element's box, giving the content breathing room.

Padding can be set using:
-padding-top
-padding-right
-padding-bottom
-padding-left
      Or 
-you can apply padding to all four sides at once using padding.

Example:
padding: 10px;
padding: 10px 20px;

Padding is transparent and does not have any background of its own. However, if the element has a background color or image, it extends into the padding.

3. Border
The border wraps around the padding (if any) and the content. It is like a visible edge or outline of an element. It defines the element's boundary and can be styled using several 

Border can be set using:
-border-width: Thickness of the border (e.g., 2px)
-border-style: Style of the line (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted)
-border-color: Color of the border (e.g., red, black, #333)


Example:
border: 2px solid red;

Borders can also be defined on each side individually like border-top, border-right, etc. Rounded corners can be added using border-radius.

4. Margin
Margin is the space outside the border. It defines the distance between the current element and its neighboring elements. Margins collapse vertically, meaning that when two vertical margins meet (like between two paragraphs), only the larger of the two is applied.

Margins can be set using:
-margin-top
-margin-right
-margin-bottom
-margin-left
       or
-you can apply padding to all four sides at once using margin.


Example:
margin: 20px;

Margins are always transparent and do not inherit background colors.

Layout Tools in CSS:
To control how boxes behave in a layout, CSS provides several key tools. Two of the most important are Display and Position.

1. Display Property
The display property determines how an element is rendered in the layout—whether it takes a full line, stays inline, or behaves like both.

-Types of Display:
1. display: block;
The element takes the full width of its container. It starts on a new line. Examples: <div>, <section>, <p>

2. display: inline;
The element takes only as much width as it needs and stays in line with other elements. Width and height properties do not apply. Examples: <span>, <a>

3. display: inline-block;
Combines the inline and block behaviors. It flows with inline elements but respects width and height properties.

4. display: none;
Hides the element completely from the page. It is removed from the normal document flow and does not occupy any space.

2. Position Property
The position property defines how an element is positioned in the document or relative to its container or the viewport.

Position Values:
I. static (default):
This is the default value. The element is positioned according to the normal document flow (from top to bottom).

II. relative:
The element is positioned relative to its original position. You can use top, right, bottom, or left to slightly move it from its normal flow position.

III. absolute:
The element is completely removed from normal flow and positioned relative to the nearest positioned (non-static) ancestor. If no such ancestor exists, it is positioned relative to the <html> element (viewport).

IV. fixed:
The element is positioned relative to the viewport, meaning it stays in the same place even when the page is scrolled. Often used for sticky headers or floating buttons.

V. sticky:
A hybrid between relative and fixed. The element behaves like relative until a certain scroll position is reached, then it sticks to the specified position.

Use Case Example:

<div style="width:200px; padding:10px; border:2px solid black; margin:20px; position: relative ;">
    This is a box.
</div>
In this case:
The content is "This is a box."
It has 10px padding on all sides.
It has a black solid border of 2px.
There is 20px of space outside (margin).
It is relatively positioned.
